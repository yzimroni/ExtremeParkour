Allow the plugin to handle 2 (or more) types or parkour (or races):
Normal, the current type
Elytra, elytra parkour

For the elytra parkour there will be more options:
Give elytra when starting?
Give firework when starting?
Unlimited fireworks?

And we also need to change the way points works, The points in the elytra parkour can be:
Distance point, the player must pass near the point
Tripwire point, the player must activate tirewire hook near the point (allow for the parkour creator to create "gates")

Elytra parkour can also use normal points

2:
There will be only one parkour type, and the options for the elytra parkour will be on every parkour
(Additional options: allow elytra in the parkour)
For the points, each point will have "mode", block (the player need to step on the block), pass near (go near the point) and tripwire
This way we dont need to change alot of things but it still works
